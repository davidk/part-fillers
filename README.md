# Parts

A repository of all the hardware parts i've encountered, bought, and used. Listed by vendor, and mostly so that I can keep track of what is good out there. Maybe it'll help you too?

This used to be called `part-fillers`, but I think any user buying parts off of a big site should know what to add to pad out a cart.

As a general rule, I don't add bottom of the barrel stuff, but use discretion when ordering. 

Feel free to contribute your own parts as well!

# Distributors

To start digging, click through to one of these distributors:

## [Digikey](digikey.md)

## [Mouser](mouser.md)

**Tip**: Distributors like Digikey/Mouser will accept each other's part numbers. This means you can enter a Mouser part number on the Digikey site and get the matching part back (if its stocked).
