# Part Fillers!

This is a public repository containing a list of what you can buy when shipping charges 
are costlier than what you're ordering! The idea is that you'll almost always not feel guilty
when buying stuff on this list, since they're common components or easy little projects.

Please feel free to fork, add your own, and send a pull request to incorporate stuff. Tables in
Markdown are pretty easy :)

Bottom of the basement stuff is avoided where possible/known. No point in buying crappy stuff; it'll
just get thrown away for better parts or blow up stuff down the line. If you see something more cost effective
(with decent quality); please feel free to add it.
