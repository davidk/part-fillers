# Part Fillers

Fill out your cart at Digikey/Mouser with generic items that you'll be sort-of
glad to have whenever inspiration strikes.

Bottom of the barrel stuff is avoided where possible, but use discretion when
ordering. Most of the parts listed here have been tested.

Feel free to contribute your own parts as well and to use this as a playground
for trying out laid back pull requests.

### Sources and acknowledgements

Half the trouble of filling out this list is finding good quality/tested parts. This means that sometimes parts are borrowed from high quality projects
which freely list their Bill of Materials. The following is thanks in general to these projects; you may be able to use parts found on this list to build some of these.
